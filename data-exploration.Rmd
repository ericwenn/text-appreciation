```{r}
source("main.R")
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ratings <- load_ratings()
```

```{r}
boxplot(ratings[c("interest", "comprehension", "complexity")])
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=ratings) + geom_point(aes(x = comprehension, y = complexity, color = interest))
```


Look at correlation between familiarity, complexity, and comprehension to interest.
```{r}
cor(ratings[, c("familiarity", "complexity", "comprehension")], ratings$interest)
```

See if we can produce a linear model between these variables
```{r}
linearMod <- lm(interest ~ complexity + comprehension, data = ratings)
summary(linearMod)
```
